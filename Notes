Okta

- Client credential flow

- The client credentials flow is a server-to-server flow that allows applications to request resources on behalf of itself rather than a user. 
- The client credentials flow requires the client id and the client secret, and exchanges those for an access token.


- Add the application into Okta aplications tab.
- add atlease one scope.
- add atlease one access policy and one rule.
- add atleast one user and groups.

- we need to send the client id and secret to the token url to get the token from Okta.
- Then we need to pass this token as a bearer token in the subsequent request wich we want to request.
- we need to validate the token in backend in .net core (check OktaJwtvalidation file in project)
- if the token is valid, it will return the requested resource.
